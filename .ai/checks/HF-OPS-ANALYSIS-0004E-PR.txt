### Environment Versions
- NODE: v22.18.0
- PNPM: 10.14.0
- HEAD SHA: 266fac4
- BRANCH: watchdog/probe-001

### PR Creation Instructions

#### Manual PR Creation (GitHub CLI not available)
1. **Open GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/Olienter/MastroHUB-v2
2. **Click "Compare & pull request"** for `watchdog/probe-001` branch
3. **PR Title**: "REDTEAM: Watchdog Test with Controlled Errors"
4. **PR Description**:
   ```
   ## Red-team Test for Watchdog Validation
   
   This PR contains controlled errors to test the Watchdog CI job:
   - Console errors (synthetic console.error)
   - A11y issues (duplicate H1, missing labels, no alt text)
   - SEO regression (missing description, og:image)
   - Performance impact (400kB blocking script)
   - Hydration mismatch (server vs client diff)
   - Network 404 (broken link)
   
   **Expected**: Watchdog should detect all issues and report warnings
   **Status**: Will be reverted after validation
   ```

### Expected GitHub Actions Results

#### CI Pipeline Stages
1. **hard-fail** ✓ (build, typecheck, lint)
2. **watchdog** ✓ (Playwright crawl with path filter)
3. **Artifact upload** ✓ (watchdog report)

#### Expected Watchdog Findings
- **Console Errors**: ≥1 (synthetic console.error) → Warning ✓
- **A11y Serious Issues**: ≥3 (duplicate H1, missing label, no alt) → Warning ✓
- **SEO Issues**: 2 (missing description, og:image) → Warning ✓
- **Performance Impact**: ~400kB script → Warning ✓
- **Hydration Mismatch**: server vs client diff → Warning ✓
- **Network 404**: ≥1 request → Warning ✓

### Seeded Errors Implementation

#### app/page.tsx
- Console error: `console.error('WatchdogTest: synthetic console error')`
- A11y: duplicate H1, missing label, no alt text
- Performance: import of 400kB script
- Hydration: `new Date().toISOString()` server/client diff
- Network: broken link `/definitely-not-found`

#### app/layout.tsx
- SEO: missing description and og:image

#### public/huge-test.js
- Performance: 400kB blocking script

### CI Workflow Configuration

#### Path Filter
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'app/**'
      - 'components/**'
```

#### Watchdog Job
```yaml
watchdog:
  needs: hard-fail
  if: contains(github.event.pull_request.files.*.path, 'app/') || contains(github.event.pull_request.files.*.path, 'components/')
  steps:
    - name: Setup Playwright
      run: npx playwright install --with-deps
    - name: Run Watchdog
      run: pnpm exec playwright test tests/watchdog.spec.ts --reporter=line
    - name: Upload Watchdog artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
```

### Next Steps After PR Creation

1. **Wait for CI run** to complete
2. **Extract findings** from Watchdog job logs
3. **Update evidence** with real GA run data
4. **Create revert PR** to restore original code
5. **Verify green Watchdog** after revert
