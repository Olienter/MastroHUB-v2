NODE: v22.18.0
PNPM: 10.14.0
PLAYWRIGHT: 1.41.2
HEAD: ee6d3c3

RESULT: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
NOTES:
- Snapshot baseline stabilization implementation completed
- Deterministic test environment configured
- Playwright artifacts excluded from Git
- PNG files protected from EOL filters

--- IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS ---
âœ… .gitignore - Added test-results/ and playwright-report/ exclusions
âœ… tests/playwright.config.ts - Deterministic use/expect configuration
âœ… tests/ui-snapshots.spec.ts - Font loading, animation disabling, networkidle
âœ… .gitattributes - Binary file protection (*.png, *.webm, *.zip)
âœ… Git cache - Removed test-results/ and playwright-report/ artifacts

--- DETERMINISTIC CONFIGURATION ---
âœ… Viewport: 1280x800 (fixed)
âœ… Locale: en-US
âœ… Timezone: UTC
âœ… ColorScheme: light
âœ… Geolocation: 0,0
âœ… Permissions: []
âœ… Screenshot: maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.01, animations: disabled

--- STABILIZATION FEATURES ---
âœ… Font loading: document.fonts.ready
âœ… Animation disabling: CSS override
âœ… Network waiting: networkidle
âœ… Binary protection: PNG/WebM/ZIP as binary

--- NEXT STEPS ---
1. Test baseline stability: npx playwright test --config tests/playwright.config.ts
2. Verify no "writing actual" messages
3. Confirm deterministic rendering across runs
4. Ready for CI/CD integration
