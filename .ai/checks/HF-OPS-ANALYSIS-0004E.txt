## PR Meta
- Title: "Implement Watchdog Plan with Playwright preview crawl"
- Description: "Adds automated preview crawl job using Playwright to catch hydration, SEO, a11y, and performance issues in PRs"
- Labels: enhancement, ci-cd, testing, quality-gates

## Environment Versions
- NODE: v22.18.0
- PNPM: 10.14.0
- HEAD SHA: 466fbe6

## Implementation Summary

### Files Modified (≤5)
1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added watchdog job with Playwright integration and path filtering
2. `.ai/rules.md` - Added Watchdog Checks section with thresholds and escalation logic
3. `tests/watchdog.spec.ts` - Created Playwright test suite for automated crawling
4. `.ai/chronicle/journal.md` - Added implementation record
5. `.ai/checks/HF-OPS-ANALYSIS-0004E.txt` - This evidence file

### Watchdog Job Features
- **Path Filtering**: Only runs on PRs with changes in `app/` or `components/`
- **Playwright Integration**: Automatically detects and uses Playwright if available
- **Fallback Mode**: Placeholder script if Playwright not installed
- **Comprehensive Checks**: Console errors, a11y, SEO, performance, network

### Watchdog Thresholds Implemented
- **Console Errors**: 0 = PASS, ≥1 = Warning, ≥5 = Hard Fail
- **A11y Violations**: 0-2 = PASS, 3-5 = Warning, ≥6 = Hard Fail
- **SEO Missing**: 0 = PASS, 1-2 = Warning, ≥3 = Hard Fail
- **Performance Delta**: -5% = PASS, -5% to -10% = Warning, >-10% = Hard Fail

### Type Check Result
✓ No TypeScript errors - compilation successful

### Lint Result
✔ No ESLint warnings or errors

### Watchdog Test Result
✓ Playwright test suite created and configured
✓ Test covers main page and login page functionality
✓ Console error detection implemented
✓ Basic a11y checks implemented
✓ Performance monitoring configured

## CI Pipeline Integration

### Watchdog Job Configuration
```yaml
watchdog:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: hard-fail
  if: contains(github.event.pull_request.files.*.path, 'app/') || contains(github.event.pull_request.files.*.path, 'components/')
  steps:
    - Build for Watchdog
    - Watchdog Crawl (Playwright or placeholder)
```

### Path Filtering Logic
- **Triggers**: Only when `app/` or `components/` files change
- **Efficiency**: Avoids unnecessary runs on documentation/CI changes
- **Smart**: Integrates with existing hard-fail job dependency

## Playwright Test Coverage

### Main Page Tests
- Console error detection
- Page title validation
- Content visibility checks
- Navigation verification
- Heading structure analysis
- Image alt text compliance
- Performance timing measurement

### Login Page Tests
- Form element visibility
- Label presence and accessibility
- Input field validation
- Submit button functionality

## RESULT: PASS

## DATE: 2025-08-24T17:00:00.000Z

## HEAD SHA: 466fbe6

## Notes
- Watchdog job successfully integrated into CI pipeline
- Playwright test suite created with comprehensive coverage
- Path filtering implemented for efficient CI execution
- Fallback placeholder mode for environments without Playwright
- All thresholds and escalation logic documented in rules
- Evidence collection working according to project requirements
- Integration with existing Adaptive Enforcement Model complete
