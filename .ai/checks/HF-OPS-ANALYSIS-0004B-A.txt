## Implementation Summary

### Files Modified (≤5)
1. `.ai/rules.md` - Added Adaptive Enforcement Model with thresholds and escalation logic
2. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Created 3-stage CI pipeline (hard-fail, warnings, nightly-full)
3. `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` - Added Manual Review section for content/CTA/UX
4. `CODEOWNERS` - Defined ownership for content, app, and AI workflow
5. `.ai/chronicle/journal.md` - Added implementation record

### Enforcement Levels Implemented
- **Hard Fail**: build, typecheck, lint, security (0 errors allowed)
- **Warning**: Lighthouse, a11y, tests, SEO (≤3 issues, escalate after 3x)
- **Manual Review**: Content pipeline, CTA flows, business decisions

### CI Pipeline Stages
1. **hard-fail**: build + typecheck + lint + security check
2. **warnings**: performance + a11y + tests + SEO (placeholder jobs)
3. **nightly-full**: complete analysis on main branch

## RESULT: PASS
