# MastroHUB v2

A gastronomy and hospitality magazine-style platform in English where users can register, create profiles, follow, comment, and discuss. Built with modern AI automation to run at the highest level.

## How we work (Day-0)

- **Single source of truth**: The `/.ai` directory will be our "jediný zdroj pravdy" for all development rules and quality gates
- **WRITE only after Approved**: No code changes without explicit human approval
- **≤5 files per step**: Progressive development with controlled scope

_Note: manifest_commit: INIT (until /.ai/manifest.json is created)_

**Canary CI check:** This line was added to test our automated AI quality gates workflow.
